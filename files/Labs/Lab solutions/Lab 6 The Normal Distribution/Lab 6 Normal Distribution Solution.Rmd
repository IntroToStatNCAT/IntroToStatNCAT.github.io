For exercise 1 & 2, don't remove points for not including `mean = 0` and `sd = 1` as it is just the standard normal.

For exercise 3, 4 & 5, remove a point each if they don't have the right numbers such as the cut off point, mean and sd. Same with the function as well.

## Exercise 1 (4 Points)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
pnorm(-0.33, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Exercise 2 (4 Points)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
pnorm(1.89, mean = 0, sd = 1) - pnorm(-1.89, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Exercise 3 (4 Points)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
1 - pnorm(83, mean = 77, sd = 5)
```


## Exercise 4 (4 Points)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
qnorm(0.10, mean = 77, sd = 5)
```


## Exercise 5 (4 Points)

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
qnorm(0.95, mean = 77, sd = 5)
```
