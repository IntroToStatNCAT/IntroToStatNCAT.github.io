## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of packages, and perform statistical inference using **infer**.
The data can be found in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```

### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -\> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

For this lab, we will be analyzing a new dataset called `yrbss` which is short for Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. It is a survey which uses data from high schoolers to help discover health patterns. It contains variables such as `age`, `gender`, `grade`, `hispanic`, `race`, and so on. Today we will be focusing on the variable `text_while_driving_30d` which has a "Yes" or "No" categories as input. The variable is used for the question "How many days did you text while driving in the last 30 days?"

1.  What are the counts within each category for the amount of days these students have texted while driving within the past 30 days?

2.  Among those who never wore helmets, what is the proportion of people who have texted while driving every day in the past 30 days?

Remember that you can use `filter` to limit the dataset to just non-helmet wearers.
Here, we will name the dataset `no_helmet`.

```{r no helmet}
no_helmet <- yrbss %>%
  filter(helmet_12m == "never")
```

Also, it may be easier to calculate the proportion if you create a new variable that specifies whether the individual has texted every day while driving over the past 30 days or not.
We will call this variable `text_ind`.

```{r indicator-texting}
no_helmet <- no_helmet %>%
  mutate(text_ind = ifelse(text_while_driving_30d == "30", "yes", "no"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(text_ind))
```

## Inference on proportions

When summarizing the YRBSS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeks insight into the population *parameters*.
To do this, you can answer the question, "What proportion of people in your sample reported that they have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days?" with a statistic; while the question "What proportion of people on earth have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days?" is answered with an estimate of the parameter.

The inferential tools for estimating population proportion are analogous to those used for means in the last chapter: the confidence interval and the hypothesis test.

```{r nohelmet-text-ci}
prop_test(no_helmet,
          text_ind ~ NULL,
          success = "yes",
          z = TRUE,
          conf_int = TRUE,
          conf_level = 0.95, correct = FALSE)
```

Note that since the goal is to construct an interval estimate for a proportion, it's necessary to include the `success` argument, which accounts for the proportion of non-helmet wearers that have consistently texted while driving in the past 30 days, in this example.

3.  What is the margin of error for the estimate of the proportion of non-helmet wearers that have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days based on this survey?

4.  Using the `infer` package, calculate confidence interval for one other categorical variable (you'll need to decide which level to call "success"), and report the associated margin of error. Interpret the interval in context of the data. It may be helpful to create new data set for the new variable first, and then use the data set to construct the confidence interval.

## How does the proportion affect the margin of error?

Imagine you've set out to survey 1000 people on two questions: are you at least 6-feet tall?
and are you left-handed?
Since both of these sample proportions were calculated from the same sample size, they should have the same margin of error, right?
Wrong!
While the margin of error does change with sample size, it is also affected by the proportion.

Think back to the formula for the standard error: $SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$.
This is then used in the formula for the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval: $$
ME = 1.96\times SE = 1.96\times\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \,.
$$ Since the population proportion $p$ is in this $ME$ formula, it should make sense that the margin of error is in some way dependent on the population proportion.
We can visualize this relationship by creating a plot of $ME$ vs. $p$.

Since sample size is irrelevant to this discussion, let's just set it to some value ($n = 1000$) and use this value in the following calculations:

```{r n-for-me-plot}
n <- 1000
```

The first step is to make a variable `p` that is a sequence from 0 to 1 with each number incremented by 0.01.
You can then create a variable of the margin of error (`me`) associated with each of these values of `p` using the above formula ($ME = 1.96 \times SE$).

```{r p-me}
p <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
me <- 1.96 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
```

Lastly, you can plot the two variables against each other to reveal their relationship.
To do so, we need to first put these variables in a data frame that you can call in the `ggplot` function.

```{r me-plot}
dd <- data.frame(p = p, me = me)
ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = p, y = me)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Population Proportion", y = "Margin of Error")
```

5.  Describe the relationship between `p` and `me`. Include the margin of error vs. population proportion plot you constructed in your answer. For a given sample size, for which value of `p` is margin of error maximized?


## Hypothesis testing

A researcher wants to test if among students who didn't wear helmets, the proportion of students who texted while driving everyday in the past 30 days is different than 8\%.

To test this research question, we set up and run the following hypothesis test.

\[ H_0: p = 0.08 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ H_A: p \ne 0.08\]

```{r nohelmet-text-HT}
prop_test(no_helmet,
          text_ind~NULL,
          success = "yes",
          p = 0.08,
          z = TRUE)
```

6. Based on the result, would you reject or fail to reject $H_0$?

7. Set up a Hypothesis test for the variable from exercise 4 and explain why the null hypothesis should be rejected or not?
