## Getting Started


### Load R Packages

`R` is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute packages that make our lives easier, and we can use them for free. For this lab, and many others in the future, we will use the following:

-   The **tidyverse** "umbrella" package which houses a suite of many different `R` packages: for data wrangling and data visualization
-   The **openintro** `R` package: for data and custom functions with the OpenIntro resources

In the lower right hand corner click on the *Packages* tab. Type the name of each of these packages (tidyverse, openintro) into the search box to see if they have been installed. If these packages do not appear when you type in their name, install them by copying and pasting or typing the following two lines of code into the console of your RStudio session. Be sure to press enter/return after each line of code.

```{r install-packages, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("openintro")
```

After pressing enter/return, a stream of text will begin, communicating the process `R` is going through to install the package from the location you selected when you installed `R`. If you were not prompted to select a server for downloading packages when you installed `R`, RStudio may prompt you to select a server from which to download; any of them will work.

You only need to *install* packages once, but you need to *load* them each time you relaunch RStudio. We load packages with the `library` function. Copy and paste or type the the following two lines in your console to load the tidyverse and openintro packages into your working environment.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

We are choosing to use the tidyverse package because it consists of a set of packages necessary for different aspects of working with data, anything from loading data to wrangling data to visualizing data to analyzing data. Additionally, these packages share common philosophies and are designed to work together. You can find more about the packages in the tidyverse at [tidyverse.org](http://tidyverse.org/).

### Creating a reproducible lab report

Remember that we will be using R Markdown to create reproducible lab reports.
In RStudio, go to New File -\> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

See the following video describing how to get started with creating these reports for this lab, and all future labs:

## Dr. Arbuthnot's Baptism Records

### Data visualization

`R` has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the following code:

```{r plot-girls-vs-year}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_point()
```

In this code, we use the `ggplot()` function to build a plot. If you run this code chunk, a plot will appear below the code chunk. The R Markdown document displays the plot below the code that was used to generate it, to give you an idea of what the plot would look like in a final report.

The command above also looks like a mathematical function. This time, however, the function requires multiple inputs (arguments), which are separated by commas.

With `ggplot()`:

-   The first argument is always the name of the dataset you wish to use for plotting.
-   Next, you provide the variables from the dataset to be assigned to different `aes`thetic elements of the plot, such as the x and the y axes.

These commands will build a blank plot, with the variables you assigned to the x and y axes. Next, you need to tell `ggplot()` what type of visualization you would like to add to the blank template. You add another layer to the `ggplot()` by:

-   adding a `+` at the end of the line, to indicate that you are adding a layer
-   then specify the `geom`etric object to be used to create the plot.

Since we want to scatterplot, we use `geom_point()`. This tells `ggplot()` that each data point should be represented by one point on the plot. If you wanted to visualize the above plot using a line graph instead of a scatterplot, you would replace `geom_point()` with `geom_line()`. This tells `ggplot()` to draw a line from each observation with the next observation (sequentially).

```{r plot-girls-vs-year-line}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) +
  geom_line()
```

Use the plot to address the following question:

1.  Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years? How would you describe it? (To ensure that your lab report is comprehensive, be sure to include the code needed to make the plot as well as your written interpretation.)

You might wonder how you are supposed to know the syntax for the `ggplot()` function. Thankfully, `R` documents all of its functions extensively. To learn what a function does and how to use it (e.g. the function's arguments), just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're interested in into the console. Type the following in your console:

```{r plot-help, tidy = FALSE}
?ggplot
```

Notice that the help file comes to the forefront, replacing the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between the tabs by clicking on their names.

## mpg dataset

For this lab we will also be working with the `mpg` data set from the `ggplot2` package. `mpg` is a fuel economy data from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular models of cars with 234 observations and 11 variables. The data contains various information regarding the car such as `manufacturer`, `model`, `cty`, `hwy` and so on.

In order to make use of this data, we need to run the code provided in the code chunk below.

```{r}
data("mpg")
```

Let's say we want to see the distribution of the miles per gallon all the cars have within the city then we can make use of `geom_density()`. We can make a density plot by making use of the code in the chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty))+
  geom_density()
```

We can notice that the miles per gallon for cars in the city have somewhat of a right skewed distribution (a distribution where the long tail is towards the right).

2. Make a density plot for the miles per gallon on the highway. Describe the distribution.

3. Make a box plot for the engine displacement by using `geom_boxplot`. Are there any outliers? What does this mean?

So far we have only visualized numerical variables. We can also visualize categorical variable by making use of bar charts.

Now, we want to see the frequency count of fuel type in the data set. Then we can make use of the code below.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = fl))+
  geom_bar()
```

Here we can see that fuel type "r" has the highest count and type "c" has the least. But we don't know the exact count. To get the exact count, we can make use of the `table()` function as shown below.

```{r}
table(mpg$fl)
```
Here we can see that out of 234 observations in the data, 168 cars use fuel type "r", 52 cars use "p" and so on.

4. Make a bar chart plot for the class of cars. Produce a frequency table as well.

## Resources for learning R and working in RStudio

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses.

In this course we will be using the suite of R packages from the **tidyverse**. The book [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham is a fantastic resource for data analysis in R with the tidyverse. If you are Goggling for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead of Goggling "scatterplot in R", Goggle "scatterplot in R with the tidyverse".

These may come in handy throughout the semester:

-   [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
-   [Data transformation cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
-   [Data visualization cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

Note that some of the code on these cheatsheets may be too advanced for this course. However the majority of it will become useful throughout the semester.
