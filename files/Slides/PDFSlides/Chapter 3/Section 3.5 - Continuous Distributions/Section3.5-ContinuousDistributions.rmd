# Continuous distributions

## Continuous distributions

- Below is a histogram of the distribution of heights of US adults.

- The proportion of data that falls in the shaded bins gives the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm (about 5'11" to 6'1")

## From histogram to continuous distributions

Since height is a continuous numerical variable, its **probability density function** is a smooth curve.

## Probabilities from continuous distributions

Therefore, the probability that a randomly sampled US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm can also be estimated as the shaded area under the curve.

## By definition...

Since continuous probabilities are estimated as "the area under the curve", the probability of being exactly 180 cm (or any exact value) is defined as **0**.
