# Defining Probability

## Random processes

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{itemize}

\item A \textbf{random process} is a situation in which we know what outcomes could happen, but we don't know which particular outcome will happen.

\item Examples: coin tosses, die rolls, iTunes shuffle, whether the stock market goes up or down tomorrow, etc.

\item{It can be helpful to model a process as random even if it is not truly random.}

\end{itemize}

## Probability

- There are several possible interpretations of probability but they (almost) completely agree on the mathematical rules probability must follow.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $P(A) = $ Probability of event A
  \item$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $P(A) = $ Probability of event A
  \item$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
  \end{itemize}
  
- **Frequentist interpretation:**

  - The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

  - The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.
  
- **Bayesian interpretation:**

  - A Bayesian interprets probability as a subjective degree of belief: For the same even, two separate people could have different viewpoints and so assign different probabilities.
  
  - Largely popularized by revolutionary advance in computational technology and methods during the last twenty years.

A) Exactly 3 heads in 10 coin flips.
B) Exactly 3 heads in 100 coin flips.
C) Exactly 3 heads in 1000 coin flips.

## Law of large numbers

**Law of large numbers** states that as more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome, \textbf{$\hat{p}_n$}, converges to the probability of that outcome, **p**.

## Law of large numbers

\alert{When tossing a fair coin, if heads comes up on each of the 10 tosses, what do you think the chance is that another head will come  up on the next toss? 0.5, less than 0.5, or more than 0.5?}

\centering{\underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{?}}

## Law of large numbers

\alert{When tossing a fair coin, if heads comes up on each of the 10 tosses, what do you think the chance is that another head will come  up on the next toss? 0.5, less than 0.5, or more than 0.5?}

\centering{\underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{?}}

- The probability is still 0.5, or there is still a 50% chance that another head will come up on the next toss.

\centering{$P(H \text{ } on \text{ } 11^{th} \text{ } toss) = P(T \text{ } on \text{ } 11^{th} \text{ } toss) = 0.5$}

\centering{\underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{H} \underline{?}}

- The probability is still 0.5, or there is still a 50% chance that another head will come up on the next toss.

\centering{$P(H \text{ } on \text{ } 11^{th} \text{ } toss) = P(T \text{ } on \text{ } 11^{th} \text{ } toss) = 0.5$}

- The coin is not "due" for a tail.

- The coin is not "due" for a tail.

- The common misunderstanding of the LLN is that random processes are supposed to compensate for whatever happened in the past; this is just not true and is also called **gambler's fallacy** (or **law of averages**).

  
## Disjoint and non-disjoint outcomes

**Disjoint (mutually exclusive) outcomes:** Cannot happen at the same time.

- The outcome of a single coint toss cannot be a head and a tail.

- A student both cannot fail and pass a class.

- A single card drawn from a deck cannot be an ace and a queen.

## Disjoint and non-disjoint outcomes

**Disjoint (mutually exclusive) outcomes:** Cannot happen at the same time.

- The outcome of a single coin toss cannot be a head and a tail.

- A student both cannot fail and pass a class.

- A single card drawn from a deck cannot be an ace and a queen.

**Non-disjoint outcomes:** Can happen at the same time.

- A student can get an A in Stats and A in Econ in the same semester.

## Union of non-disjoint events

\centering{$P(jack \text{ } or \text{ } red) = P(jack) + P(red) - \textcolor{red}{P(jack \text{ } and \text{ } red)}$}

\centering{$= \frac{4}{52} + \frac{26}{52} - \frac{2}{52} = \frac{28}{52}$}

\centering{P(A \emph{or} B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \emph{and} B)}

\noindent\rule{4cm}{0.4pt}

\alert{Note:} For disjoint events P(A _and_ B) = 0, so the above formula simplifies to P(A _or_ B) = P(A) + P(B).

## Practice

\alert{In a survey, 52\% of respondents said they are Democrats. What is the probability that a randomly selected respondent from this sample is a Republican?}

A) 0.48
B) More than 0.48
C) Less than 0.48
D) Cannot calculate using only the information given

## Practice

\alert{In a survey, 52\% of respondents said they are Democrats. What is the probability that a randomly selected respondent from this sample is a Republican?}

A) 0.48
B) More than 0.48
C) Less than 0.48
D) **Cannot calculate using only the information given**

If the only two political parties are Republican and Democrat, then A) is possible. However it is also possible that some people do not affiliate with a political party or affiliate with a party other than these two. Then C) is also possible. However B) is definitely not possible since it would result in the total probability for the sample space being above 1.

## Sample space and complements

**Sample space** is the collection of all possible outcomes of a trial.

- A couple has one kid, what is the sample space for the gender of this kid? $S = \{M,F\}$

- A couple has two kids, what is the sample space for the gender of these kids?

## Sample space and complements

**Sample space** is the collection of all possible outcomes of a trial.

- A couple has one kid, what is the sample space for the gender of this kid? $S = \{M,F\}$

- A couple has two kids, what is the sample space for the gender of these kids? $S = \{MM,FF,FM,MF\}$

## Sample space and complements

**Sample space** is the collection of all possible outcomes of a trial.

- A couple has one kid, what is the sample space for the gender of this kid? $S = \{M,F\}$

- A couple has two kids, what is the sample space for the gender of these kids? $S = \{MM,FF,FM,MF\}$

**Complementary events** are two mutually exclusive events whose probabilities that add up to 1.

- A couple has one kid. If we know that the kid is not a boy, what is the gender of this kid? {~~M~~, \alert{F}} $\rightarrow$ Boy and girl are **complementary** outcomes. 

- A couple has two kids, if we know that they are not both girls, what are the possible gender combinations for these kids?

## Checking for independence

If P(A occurs, given that B is true) = P(A | B) = P(A), then A and B are independent.

## Checking for independence

If P(A occurs, given that B is true) = P(A|B) = P(A), then A and B are independent.

P(protects citizens) = 0.58

## Checking for independence

If P(A occurs, given that B is true) = P(A|B) = P(A), then A and B are independent.

P(protects citizens) = 0.58

P(randomly selected NC resident says gun ownership protects citizens given the resident is white) = 

P(protects citizens | White) = 0.67

P(protects citizens | Black) = 0.28

P(protects citizens | Hispanic) = 0.64

## Checking for independence

If P(A occurs, given that B is true) = P(A|B) = P(A), then A and B are independent.

P(protects citizens) = 0.58

P(randomly selected NC resident says gun ownership protects citizens given the resident is white) = 

P(protects citizens | White) = 0.67

P(protects citizens | Black) = 0.28

P(protects citizens | Hispanic) = 0.64

P(protects citizens) varies by race/ethnicity, therefore opinion on gun ownership and race ethnicity are most likely dependent.

## Determining dependence based on sample data

- If conditional probabilities calculated based on sample data suggest dependence between two variables, the next step is to conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the observed difference between the probabilities if likely or unlikely to have by chance.

- If the observed difference between the conditional probabilities is large, then there is stronger evidence that the difference is real.

- If a sample is large, then even a small difference can provide strong evidence of a real difference.

\alert{We saw that P(protects citizens | White) = 0.67 and P(protects citizens | Hispanic) = 0.64. Under which condition would you be more convinced of a real difference between the proportions of Whites and Hispanics who think gun widespread fun owneship protects citizens? n = 500 or n = 50,000}

\raggedright\alert{You toss a coin twice, what is the probability of getting two tails in a row?}

Not necessarily, there may be more than 2 events in the sample space, e.g. Party affiliation.

## Disjoint vs. Complementary

\alert{Do the sum of probabilities of two disjoint events always add up to 1?}

Yes, that's the definition of complementary, e.g. Heads and Tails.

## Putting everything together...

\alert{If we were to randomly select 5 Texans, what is the probability that at least one is uninsured?}

- If we were to randomly select 5 Texans, the sample space for the number of Texans who are uninsured would be: 

\centering{$S = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$}

- We are interested in instances where at least one person is uninsured:

\centering{$S = \{0,\textcolor{red}{1,2,3,4,5}\}$}

- So we can divide up the sample space into two categories:

\centering{$S = \{0, \textcolor{red}{\text{at least one}}\}$}

## Putting everything together...

Since the probability of the sample space must add up to 1:

\begin{align*}
\text{Prob(at least 1 uninsured)} &= 1 - \text{Prob(none insured)}\\
\end{align*}

## Putting everything together...

Since the probability of the sample space must add up to 1:

\begin{align*}
\text{Prob(at least 1 uninsured)} &= 1 - \text{Prob(none insured)}\\
&= 1 - [(1-0.255)^5]
\end{align*}

## Putting everything together...

Since the probability of the sample space must add up to 1:

\begin{align*}
\text{Prob(at least 1 uninsured)} &= 1 - \text{Prob(none insured)}\\

&= 1 - 0.745^5

## Putting everything together...

- Susan G. Komen For The Cure Foundation states that mammography correctly identifies about 78% of women who truly have breast cancer.

  [https://www.komen.org/breast-cancer/screening/mammography/accuracy/](https://www.komen.org/breast-cancer/screening/mammography/accuracy/)
  
- An article published in 2003 suggests that up to 10% of all mammograms result in false positives for patients who do not have cancer.

## Application activity: Inverting probabilities

A common epidemiological model for the spread of diseases is the SIR model, where the population is partitioned into three groups: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. This is a reasonable model for diseases like chickenpox where a single infection usually provides immunity to subsequent infections. Sometimes these diseases can also be difficult to detect.

Imagine a population in the midst of an epidemic where 60% of the population is considered susceptible, 10% is infected, and 30% is recovered. The only test for the disease is accurate 95% of the time for susceptible individuals, 99% for infected individuals, but 65% for recovered individuals. (Note: In this case accurate means returning a negative result for susceptible and recovered individuals and positive result for infected individuals).

Draw a probability tree to reflect the information given above, If the individual has tested positive, what is the probability that they are actually infected?

## Sampling with replacement

- When drawing with replacement, probability of the second chip being blue does not depend on the color of the first chip since whatever we draw in the first draw gets put back in the bag.

\centering{$Prob(B|B) = Prob(B|O)$}

- In addition, this probability is equal to the probability of drawing a blue chip in the first draw, since the composition of the bag never changes when sampling with replacement.

- **When drawing with replacement, draws are independent.**

# Random variables

## Random variables

- A **random variable** is a numeric quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a random event.

  - We use a capital letter, like $X$, to denote a random variable.
  - The values of a random variable are denoted with a lowercase letter, in this case $x$.

- There are two types of random variables:

  - **Discrete random variables** often take only integer values.
    - Example: Number of credit hours, Difference in number of credit hours this term vs last.
    
  - **Continuous random variables** take real (decimal) values.
    - Example: Cost of books this term, Difference in cost of books this term vs last.
    

## Expectation

- We are often interested in the average outcome of a random variable.

- We call this the **expected value** (mean), and it is a weighted average of the possible outcomes

\centering{$\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_iP(X=x_i)$}

## Expected value of a discrete random variable

# Continuous distributions

## Continuous distributions

- Below is a histogram of the distribution of heights of US adults.

- The proportion of data that falls in the shaded bins gives the probability that a randomly sample US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm (about 5'11" to 6'1")

![](usHeightsHist180185.pdf)

## From histogram to continuous distributions

Since height is a continuous numerical variable, its **probability density function** is a smooth curve.

![](fdicHeightContDist.pdf)

## Probabilities from continuous distributions

Therefore, the probability that a randomly samples US adult is between 180 cm and 185 cm can also be estimated as the shaded area under the curve.

![](fdicHeightContDistFilled.pdf)

## By definition...

Since continuous probabilities are estimated as "the area under the curve", the probability of a being exactly 180 cm (or any exact value) is defined as **0**.
