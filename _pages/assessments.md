## Data Science Awareness, Readiness and Aspirations Survey

This survey instrument is designed to measure students' levels of awareness, preparedness and aspirations of Data Science.

[Survey Instrument](https://github.com/IntroToStatNCAT/IntroToStatNCAT.github.io/blob/029bafcd78178b2986e062390c63fb3599ae3e4e/files/Assessments/DS-AwarenessReadinessAspirations-Survey_Spring2022.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Intro Stats Concept Inventory

We used a modified version of the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS) test originally developed by del Mas et al. [del Mas, R., Garfield, J., Ooms, A., and Chance, B. (2007), “Assessing Students’ Conceptual Understanding After a First Course in Statistics,”
*Statistics Education Research Journal*, 6:28–58.] and modified by Chance et al. [Chance, B., Wong, J., and Tintle, N. (2016), “Student Performance in Curricula Centered on Simulation-Based Inference: A Preliminary Report,” *Journal of Statistics Education*, 24(3):114-126.]. The instrument was generously shared by Professor Nathan Tintle. **Instructors wanting to use the test in their introductory statistics courses can request a copy from test developers directly or from the project team by emailing PI Sayed Mostafa at _sabdelmegeed@ncat.edu_**.
