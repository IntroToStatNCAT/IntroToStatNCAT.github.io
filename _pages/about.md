Project Description
======

The proposed Targeted Infusion Project aims to transform the teaching of intro stats at North Carolina A&T State University (A&T) through targeted infusions of DS knowledge and big data analytics tools in the high-stakes intro stats course to enhance the statistical and data-analytical skills of and promote DS literacy among underrepresented minority (URM) students, thus preparing them for STEM graduate education and careers in the DS age. This project will develop, implement and assess a novel and replicable model for teaching intro stats using the evidence-based data-centered pedagogy to ensure development of data-analytical skills for URM students at their early stages of college education and to prepare and entice URM students from a wide spectrum of STEM and non-STEM majors to pursue DS education and careers. 

The project seeks to achieve three main goals:
* Enhance the students' statistical knowledge and data-analytical skills gained from the intro stats course.
* Create a pipeline for the new DSA programs offered at A&T
* Build a faculty cadre capable of and committed to teaching intro stats using a data-centered pedagogy to promote DS literacy among undergraduate students
