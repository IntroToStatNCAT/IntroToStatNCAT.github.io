## Online Assignments

The free online homework system [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com){:target="_blank"} is adopted for the course. The system is used to administer online homeworks, quizzes and exams. Neither instructors nor students need to pay for this homework system. Further, students only use the homework link in the learning management system to access and complete homework assignments without needing to create an account on MyOpenMath. 

For more details about integrating MyOpenMath with the learning management system (LMS), see Section 2.3 of the instructor's [implementation manual](https://github.com/IntroToStatNCAT/IntroToStatNCAT.github.io/blob/293fa3bfabcfc845174045bffc627611f1e7d909/files/ImplementationProtocol/TIP-Manual-Draft-v1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
