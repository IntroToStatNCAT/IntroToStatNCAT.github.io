## Getting Started


### Load R Packages

`R` is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute packages that make our lives easier, and we can use them for free. For this lab, and many others in the future, we will use the following:

-   The **tidyverse** "umbrella" package which houses a suite of many different `R` packages: for data wrangling and data visualization
-   The **openintro** `R` package: for data and custom functions with the OpenIntro resources

In the lower right hand corner click on the *Packages* tab. Type the name of each of these packages (tidyverse, openintro) into the search box to see if they have been installed. If these packages do not appear when you type in their name, install them by copying and pasting or typing the following two lines of code into the console of your RStudio session. Be sure to press enter/return after each line of code.

```{r install-packages, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("openintro")
```

After pressing enter/return, a stream of text will begin, communicating the process `R` is going through to install the package from the location you selected when you installed `R`. If you were not prompted to select a server for downloading packages when you installed `R`, RStudio may prompt you to select a server from which to download; any of them will work.

You only need to *install* packages once, but you need to *load* them each time you relaunch RStudio. We load packages with the `library` function. Copy and paste or type the the following two lines in your console to load the tidyverse and openintro packages into your working environment.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

We are choosing to use the tidyverse package because it consists of a set of packages necessary for different aspects of working with data, anything from loading data to wrangling data to visualizing data to analyzing data. Additionally, these packages share common philosophies and are designed to work together. You can find more about the packages in the tidyverse at [tidyverse.org](http://tidyverse.org/).

### Creating a reproducible lab report

Remember that we will be using R Markdown to create reproducible lab reports.
In RStudio, go to New File -\> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

See the following video describing how to get started with creating these reports for this lab, and all future labs:

[**Basic R Markdown with an OpenIntro Lab**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdc368lS2hk) <iframe width="669" height="502" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pdc368lS2hk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-external="1"></iframe>


## Dr. Arbuthnot's Baptism Records

### Data visualization

`R` has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the following code:

```{r plot-girls-vs-year}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_point()
```

In this code, we use the `ggplot()` function to build a plot. If you run this code chunk, a plot will appear below the code chunk. The R Markdown document displays the plot below the code that was used to generate it, to give you an idea of what the plot would look like in a final report.

The command above also looks like a mathematical function. This time, however, the function requires multiple inputs (arguments), which are separated by commas.

With `ggplot()`:

-   The first argument is always the name of the dataset you wish to use for plotting.
-   Next, you provide the variables from the dataset to be assigned to different `aes`thetic elements of the plot, such as the x and the y axes.

These commands will build a blank plot, with the variables you assigned to the x and y axes. Next, you need to tell `ggplot()` what type of visualization you would like to add to the blank template. You add another layer to the `ggplot()` by:

-   adding a `+` at the end of the line, to indicate that you are adding a layer
-   then specify the `geom`etric object to be used to create the plot.

Since we want to scatterplot, we use `geom_point()`. This tells `ggplot()` that each data point should be represented by one point on the plot. If you wanted to visualize the above plot using a line graph instead of a scatterplot, you would replace `geom_point()` with `geom_line()`. This tells `ggplot()` to draw a line from each observation with the next observation (sequentially).

```{r plot-girls-vs-year-line}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) +
  geom_line()
```

Use the plot to address the following question:

1.  Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years? How would you describe it? (To ensure that your lab report is comprehensive, be sure to include the code needed to make the plot as well as your written interpretation.)

You might wonder how you are supposed to know the syntax for the `ggplot()` function. Thankfully, `R` documents all of its functions extensively. To learn what a function does and how to use it (e.g. the function's arguments), just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're interested in into the console. Type the following in your console:

```{r plot-help, tidy = FALSE}
?ggplot
```

Notice that the help file comes to the forefront, replacing the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between the tabs by clicking on their names.

### R as a big calculator

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we could use the fact that we can use `R` as a big calculator. To do this, we can type in mathematical expressions such as the below calculation into the console.

```{r calc-total-bapt-numbers}
5218 + 4683
```

This calculation would provide us with the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could then repeat this calculation once for each year. This would probably take us a while, but luckily there is a faster way! If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to that of girls, `R` can compute each of these sums simultaneously.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```

What you will see is a list of 82 numbers. These numbers appear as a list, because we are working with vectors rather than a data frame. Each number represents the sum of how many boys and girls were baptized that year. You can take a look at the first few rows of the `boys` and `girls` columns to see if the calculation is right.

### Adding a new variable to the data frame

We are interested in using this new vector of the total number of baptisms to generate some plots, so we'll want to save it as a permanent column in our data frame. We can do this using the following code:

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars-save}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
```

This code has a lot of new pieces to it, so let's break it down. In the first line we are doing two things, (1) adding a new `total` column to this updated data frame, and (2) overwriting the existing `arbutnot` data frame with an updated data frame that includes the new `total` column. We are able to chain these two processes together using the **piping** (`%>%`) operator. The piping operator takes the output of the previous expression and "pipes it" into the first argument of the next expression.

To continue our analogy with mathematical functions, `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`. Connecting `arbuthnot` and `mutate(total = boys + girls)` with the pipe operator is the same as typing `mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)`, where `arbuthnot` becomes the first argument included in the `mutate()` function.

::: {#boxedtext}
**A note on piping:** Note that we can read these two lines of code as the following:

*"Take the `arbuthnot` dataset and **pipe** it into the `mutate` function. Mutate the `arbuthnot` data set by creating a new variable called `total` that is the sum of the variables called `boys` and `girls`. Then assign the resulting dataset to the object called `arbuthnot`, i.e. overwrite the old `arbuthnot` dataset with the new one containing the new variable."*

This is equivalent to going through each row and adding up the `boys` and `girls` counts for that year and recording that value in a new column called `total`.
:::

<div>

**Where is the new variable?** When you make changes to variables in your dataset, click on the name of the dataset again to update it in the data viewer.

</div>

You'll see that there is now a new column called `total` that has been tacked onto the data frame. The special symbol `<-` performs an *assignment*, taking the output of the piping operations and saving it into an object in your environment. In this case, you already have an object called `arbuthnot` in your environment, so this command updates that data set with the new mutated column.

You can make a line plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the following code:

```{r plot-total-vs-year}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = total)) + 
  geom_line()
```

In an similar fashion, once you know the total number of baptisms for boys and girls in 1629, you can compute the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized with the following code:

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-numbers}
5218 / 4683
```

Alternatively, you could calculate this ratio for every year by acting on the complete `boys` and `girls` columns, and then save those calculations into a new variable named `boy_to_girl_ratio`:

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-vars}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boy_to_girl_ratio = boys / girls)
```

You can also compute the proportion of newborns that are boys in 1629 with the following code:

```{r calc-prop-boys-numbers}
5218 / (5218 + 4683)
```

Or you can compute this for all years simultaneously and add it as a new variable named `boy_ratio` to the dataset:

```{r calc-prop-boys-vars}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boy_ratio = boys / total)
```

Notice that rather than dividing by `boys + girls` we are using the `total` variable we created earlier in our calculations!

2.  Now, generate a plot of the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see?

<div>

**Tip:** If you use the up and down arrow keys in the console, you can scroll through your previous commands, your so-called command history. You can also access your command history by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel. This can save you a lot of typing in the future.

</div>

Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, `>`, less than, `<`, and equality, `==`. For example, we can create a new variable called `more_boys` that tells us whether the number of births of boys outnumbered that of girls in each year with the following code:

```{r boys-more-than-girls}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(more_boys = boys > girls)
```

This command adds a new variable to the `arbuthnot` data frame containing the values of either `TRUE` if that year had more boys than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This variable contains a different kind of data than we have encountered so far. All other columns in the `arbuthnot` data frame have values that are numerical (the year, the number of boys and girls). Here, we've asked R to create *logical* data, data where the values are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using `R` is that it is able to represent and compute with many of them.

## More Practice

In the previous few pages, you recreated some of the displays and preliminary analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Your assignment involves repeating these steps, but for present day birth records in the United States. The data are stored in a data frame called `present`.

To find the minimum and maximum values of columns, you can use the functions `min()` and `max()` within a `summarize()` call, which you will learn more about in the following lab.

Here's an example of how to find the minimum and maximum amount of boy births in a year:

```{r summarize min and max}
arbuthnot %>%
  summarize(min = min(boys),
            max = max(boys)
            )
```

Answer the following questions with the `present` data frame:

3.  What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the data frame? What are the variable (column) names?

4.  How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they of a similar magnitude?

5.  Make a plot that displays the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being born in greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your response. *Hint:* You should be able to reuse your code from Exercise 3 above, just replace the name of the data frame.

6.  In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? *Hint:* First calculate the totals and save it as a new variable. Then, sort your dataset in descending order based on the `total` column. You can do this interactively in the data viewer by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. To include the sorted result in your report you will need to use two new functions. First we use `arrange()` to sorting the variable. Then we can arrange the data in a descending order with another function, `desc()`, for descending order. The sample code is provided below.

```{r sample-arrange, eval=FALSE}
present %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
```

These data come from reports by the Centers for Disease Control. You can learn more about them by bringing up the help file using the command `?present`.

## Resources for learning R and working in RStudio

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses.

In this course we will be using the suite of R packages from the **tidyverse**. The book [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham is a fantastic resource for data analysis in R with the tidyverse. If you are Goggling for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead of Goggling "scatterplot in R", Goggle "scatterplot in R with the tidyverse".

These may come in handy throughout the semester:

-   [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
-   [Data transformation cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
-   [Data visualization cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

Note that some of the code on these cheatsheets may be too advanced for this course. However the majority of it will become useful throughout the semester.
