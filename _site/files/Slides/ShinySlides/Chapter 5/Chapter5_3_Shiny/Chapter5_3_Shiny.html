<p>\[𝐻_0:𝑝= \frac{1}{3} \ \ \text{versus} \ \ 𝐻_𝑎:𝑝&gt; \frac{1}{3}\]</p>

<li>The P-value is the probability calculated using the observed statistic \(\hat{p}\) (here, \(\hat{p}=40/116= 0.3448\)) and the p-value describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations as in the direction of alternative hypothesis (greater than 0.3448) if the null hypothesis were true.</li>
